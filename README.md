This program is a WIP to analyze laser beams and their intensity distributions.
This diagnostic was done with a 834nm laser beam and diagnostic has been done following the laser, post amplifier, 
and post optical fiber to analyze the beams distribution in order maximize coupling to create a vortex beam.
This project over all aim to analyze a light beam that possess angular momentum.
Currently only guassian beams with X-Y contours have been analyzed, but improvements to this are coming.
Vortex analysis should come in the following weeks.
